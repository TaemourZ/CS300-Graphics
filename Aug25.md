# **CLASS NOTES** by Taemour Zaidi

### Which is preferred?:
- **TVs:** Raster 
- **Printing on Plotters:** Vector
- **Digital Cameras:** Raster
- **Text:** Vector
- **Maps:** Depends. Some use Rastors like Google Maps. Other GPS systems use Vector
- **Paintings (Digital Art)** Vector

### What are the main types of raster images?
- Indexed images (from color map or color lookup table)
- Intensity images (grayscale)
- RGB images (each pixel has R, G, B valyes)
- Binary images (each pixel is either white [ON] or black [OFF])


## QUESTIONS
1. Give some examples of display hardware used in computer graphics. Please attach some pictures to support your answers.
2. What is the different between raster and vector images? Which is better from your perspective?
3. What is Raster-Scan Display and how does it work? What is Random-Scan Display and how does it work? Compare both.
    - In ***Raster Scan Displays*** an electron beam sweeps across the screen, from top to bottom covering one row at a time. A pattern of illuminated pattern of spots is created by turning beam intensity on and off as it moves across each row. It is used to display Raster Graphics.
    - In ***Random-Scan Display*** an electron beam is directed only to the areas of screen where a picture has to be drawn. It can draw and refresh component lines of a picture in any specified sequence. It is also called vector display, as it draws picture one line at time, and is used to display Vector Graphics.
