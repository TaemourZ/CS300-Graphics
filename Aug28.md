- These images can take the form of photographs, graphics, and individual video frames. Therefore, an image is a picture that was created or copied and stored in electronic form.

## Image File Formats

Image files are composed of digital data in one of image file formats so that the data can be displayed on a digital display or printed out using a printer

**There are two main types of image file formats:**
1. Native image files: they are specifically to be used with one software. Like aseprite has `.ase` format.
2. Common Image File Formats: they can be used by multiple different types of software, more general use files.

## Native File Formats
- Many applications have their own native file format
- This type of file format is created by a specific software or application and can retain all needed information about the image such as layers, transparency, masks and other adjustments.
- It is always good to save a version of an image in the native format if you plan to make future edits to the image, because the native file format will keep all editing information.
- **Raster image editors:**
    - Adobe Photoshop document (.psd)
    - GIMP Experimental Computing Facility(.xcf)
- **Vector image editors:**
    - Adobe Illustrator (.ai)
    - CorelDRAW (.cdr)
